# Traffic Queue Predictor using Numerical Method
<<<<<<< HEAD

The goal of this project is to predict continuous data using linear, non-linear regression and linear, quadratic interpolation.
The traffic queue data was assessed in two days within 1 hour. To carry out this project, I need to find out the length of traffic queue (in meters) right before
the red light expires, and also record the time it occurred so that we have the x-value (the time) and y-value (traffic queue length) data. Since the red light expires
every 2 minutes, there will be 30 data for a single day. The first day observation was conducted on 23th of April 2021 while the second day observation was conducted on
